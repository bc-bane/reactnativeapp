## React Native Todo List

The goal of this exercise is to create a working todo list, there is currently no working mechanism for completing or deleting todo items.

## Take Note
1. You do not need to worry about adding styling the app, we know it doesn't look great.
2. You ARE allowed to use google or other resources to look things up, just make sure you share your screen for that and talk through the process.
3. This is not a PASS/FAIL coding challenge, and you don't automatically fail if you miss something or one of the points. We are reviewing your overall thought process, communication skills, and the way you determine a solution just as much are we are reviewing the final product.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a todo item should toggle the "checked" state.
2. Implement deletion of the todo items.
3. Add createdAt timestamps to the items when they are added, and display them in the TodoItem. Update the initialData to include timestamps and assign valid values to each item. MomentJS is installed for formatting the dates on the TodoItem.
4. Update the app to sort the items with newest items at the bottom.
