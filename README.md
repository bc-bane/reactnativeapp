## React Todo List

The goal of this exercise is to create a working todo list with persistent data storage.

To start with, we have a styled todo list that supports adding todos. We also have premade styles for completed todo items. Although there's no working mechanism for "completing" a todo.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a todo item should toggle the "checked" state.
2. Implement deletion of the todo items.
3. Add creation timestamps to the items.
4. Update the list to sort the items with newest at the bottom.
